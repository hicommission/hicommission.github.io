        <p id="content-txt">Africa Self-Help is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing growth opportunities and expanding science, Innovation and Technology interlinkages for in and out-of-school youth in Blekusu, Volta Region, connecting them with information about interesting and exciting trends and initiatives in Ghana and around the world to create a happier and more fulfilling growth and development experience. We hope that our generation can create a sense of self-worth and confidence in our youth and pass a beautiful Ghana on to future generations. We aim to spread inspiration, insight, motivation and encouragement among the youth.</p>

        <div class="content-text">
          <p id="vision-txt">Today, people of African descent are active everywhere in the social, cultural, academic and economic spheres of human development striving for excellence against all odds. There is no lack of opportunity for future generations of Africans to rise to the challenge of leadership as captains of industry and competent wealth managers capable of ushering in a new paradigm of thought, self-esteem and action. This new paradigm will rebuild and strengthen the connections between people of African descent wherever they live, their communities, countries, society and the Earth. We cannot live without being connected with other people and society. But we must first reclaim our heritage and self-worth and connections with our inner selves, with society and with nature. In a small way, Africa Self-Help wishes to serve as the platform for this vision of interconnectedness of our collective destiny and the building of the African personality required to nurture this vision starting with connecting young people in Blekusu and neighboring towns in Ghana via broad-band internet connection. No doubt there is a sense of urgency to spread this vision and the word across Ghana and the African diaspora building upon and integrating traditional African ideas, wisdom and principles into active youth consciousness – a rich heritage to share with the world.

      <h3>What would happen if we brought broadband internet to all the people in Blekusu and the neighboring towns? </h3>
      <p id="project-txt">Clearly, the rapid rollout of broadband services has transformed the lives of people all over the world. It should be no different for the people of our homeland. There is every reason to expect that everyone would benefit. It would enable many new enterprises to start and take root and all the spillovers that come with modern innovation – information, knowledge and education in mathematics, English and science will flourish, there will be more jobs, greater efficiency, bigger markets for our goods and services, and faster innovation. Tourism would get a major boost. It would also assist in achieving better outcomes in health and poverty reduction. In short, it would deliver a significant boost to human development and our local economy – raising our self-worth and our self-esteem.</p>
